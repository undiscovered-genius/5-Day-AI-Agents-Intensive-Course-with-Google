This deeper understanding can reveal novel vulnerabilities or strategies for intervention.\n*   **Impact:** Leads to more targeted and effective drug design.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **Biotech Startups:** A significant portion of innovation is coming from agile biotech startups specializing in AI-driven drug discovery.\n*   **Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI drug discovery companies to leverage their technologies.\n*   **Integration of Different AI Modalities:** Combining different AI techniques (e.g., machine learning for prediction, deep learning for image analysis, and generative AI for design) is becoming standard practice.\n*   **Focus on Specific Disease Areas:** While AI can be broadly applied, many efforts are focused on areas with high unmet needs, such as oncology, neurodegenerative diseases, and infectious diseases.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite the progress, challenges persist, including the need for high-quality, curated data, ensuring the interpretability of AI models, navigating regulatory hurdles, and the inherent complexity of biological systems.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just a buzzword in drug discovery anymore; it's a fundamental tool that is reshaping how we find, design, and develop new medicines, promising faster, more efficient, and potentially more effective treatments for a wide range of diseases.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned: **AI for Target Identification and Validation**. This is a really crucial area because finding the right target is the absolute first step in developing a new drug. If you're trying to hit a specific problem, you need to know exactly what you're aiming for.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing target identification and validation:\n\n**The Problem AI is Solving:**\n\n*   **Data Overload:** The sheer volume of biological data is staggering. We have genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, clinical data, and a vast amount of published scientific literature. Humans struggle to process and connect all these disparate pieces of information effectively.\n*   **Complexity of Biology:** Biological systems are incredibly complex, with intricate networks of interactions. Identifying the key \"nodes\" (targets) that, when modulated, can significantly impact a disease is a monumental task.\n*   **Unmet Needs:** Many diseases, especially chronic and rare ones, lack effective treatments because we haven't identified the right biological targets to go after.\n*   **Cost and Time:** Traditional target identification often relies on laborious experimentation and hypothesis-driven research, which can be slow and expensive.\n\n**How AI is Helping:**\n\n1.  **Integrating Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **What AI does:** AI algorithms, particularly machine learning and deep learning, can ingest and analyze data from different \"omics\" layers simultaneously. For example, it can look at how genetic variations (genomics) affect protein expression (proteomics) and metabolic activity (metabolomics) in disease states.\n    *   **How it helps:** By finding correlations and patterns across these layers, AI can pinpoint genes or proteins that are consistently dysregulated in a disease and are likely to be causal or critical drivers.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might identify a specific protein that is overexpressed in cancer cells and is also involved in a pathway that promotes tumor growth, making it a prime drug target.\n\n2.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Literature Mining:**\n    *   **What AI does:** NLP algorithms can read and \"understand\" vast amounts of scientific literature, extracting key information about genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, and experimental findings.\n    *   **How it helps:** AI can identify connections, hypotheses, and experimental evidence that a human researcher might miss, especially if they are spread across thousands of papers. It can also highlight emerging trends or under-researched areas.\n    *   **Example:** An NLP system could scan all published research on Alzheimer's and identify a gene that is frequently mentioned in the context of protein aggregation but has not yet been explicitly proposed as a therapeutic target.\n\n3.  **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:**\n    *   **What AI does:** AI can build complex network models representing biological pathways and interactions within cells or organisms. It can then simulate perturbations to these networks.\n    *   **How it helps:** By understanding how different components are connected, AI can predict which nodes (targets) are most \"central\" or \"critical\" for disease progression. It can also predict the downstream effects of modulating a particular target, helping to assess its potential therapeutic benefit and side effects.\n    *   **Example:** If a disease is caused by an overactive signaling cascade, AI can model this cascade and identify the most upstream or essential enzyme to inhibit to effectively shut down the problematic signal.\n\n4.  **Predicting Druggability:**\n    *   **What AI does:** Once a potential target is identified, AI can help assess whether it's a \"druggable\" target – meaning if it's feasible to design a drug molecule that can bind to it effectively and modulate its activity. This involves analyzing the target's protein structure, binding sites, and known interactions.\n    *   **How it helps:** This saves resources by filtering out targets that are unlikely to yield successful drug candidates.\n    *   **Example:** AI might analyze the 3D structure of a protein and predict that its active site is too flat or too small to bind a small molecule drug.\n\n5.  **Identifying Novel Biomarkers:**\n    *   **What AI does:** AI can identify biomarkers (measurable indicators) associated with disease presence, progression, or response to treatment. These biomarkers can be linked to specific targets.\n    *   **How it helps:** This can not only validate a target but also help in patient stratification for clinical trials and in diagnosing diseases earlier.\n\n**Recent Advancements and Examples:**\n\n*   **AI-powered platforms:** Companies are developing integrated platforms that combine these AI capabilities to offer end-to-end target discovery services.\n*   **Focus on \"Undruggable\" Targets:** A significant effort is underway to use AI to find ways to target proteins that were previously considered \"undruggable,\" such as certain transcription factors or protein-protein interactions.\n*   **Validation through CRISPR and other techniques:** Once AI identifies a potential target, experimental validation using tools like CRISPR gene editing is crucial. AI can help guide these experiments by predicting the most effective genes to edit.\n\n**In essence, AI acts as an incredibly powerful magnifying glass and pattern-recognition engine for biological data, allowing researchers to see previously hidden connections and identify the most promising points of intervention for developing new medicines.** This is fundamentally changing the pace and success rate of the initial, most challenging stage of drug discovery.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Identifying the \"main\" companies in AI-driven target identification and validation can be tricky because the landscape is constantly evolving, with new players emerging and established ones forming partnerships.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
