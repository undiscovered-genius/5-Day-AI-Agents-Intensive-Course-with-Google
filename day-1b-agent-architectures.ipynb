What if individual components could collaborate, learn, and adapt to solve complex problems more efficiently than ever before? That's the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and for software developers, it's a paradigm shift worth exploring.\n\nMAS offers a powerful way to tackle software development challenges. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, developers can focus on individual agents, making development and debugging significantly easier. This modularity also unlocks true scalability; instead of wrestling with monolithic applications, you can dynamically add or remove agents based on workload demands. The magic often lies in emergent behaviors – simple agent interactions can lead to sophisticated, hard-to-design-top-down solutions.\n\nBeyond efficiency, MAS enhances robustness. If one agent fails, the entire application doesn't crumble. This fault tolerance, coupled with self-healing capabilities where agents can take over for their peers, ensures higher availability and resilience. Modularity here means easier bug isolation, preventing unintended consequences.\n\nFlexibility and adaptability are also hallmarks of MAS. Systems can learn from their environment and adjust behavior in real-time, vital for dynamic applications. Integrating new features becomes as simple as introducing a new agent, rather than a complex re-architecture. Resource management is optimized too, with computational loads distributed intelligently across specialized agents, maximizing performance and minimizing latency.\n\nMulti-Agent Systems are more than a concept; they're a toolkit for building smarter, more resilient, and adaptable software. Embrace this collaborative approach and unlock new levels of innovation.\nEditorAgent > ## Unleash Your Code's Potential: How Multi-Agent Systems Can Revolutionize Software Development\n\nImagine your software not just running, but actively *thinking*. What if individual components could collaborate, learn, and adapt to solve complex problems with unprecedented efficiency? This is the transformative promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), a paradigm shift that holds immense value for software developers.\n\nMAS provides a powerful framework for tackling intricate software development challenges. By decomposing complex tasks into smaller, more manageable units, developers can concentrate on individual agents, significantly streamlining both development and debugging processes. This inherent modularity also unlocks true scalability. Instead of grappling with the complexities of monolithic applications, you can dynamically add or remove agents as workload demands fluctuate. A key advantage lies in emergent behaviors: the simple interactions between individual agents can give rise to sophisticated solutions that are exceptionally difficult to design using traditional top-down approaches.\n\nBeyond mere efficiency, MAS dramatically enhances robustness. In a well-designed MAS, the failure of a single agent does not cause the entire application to collapse. This inherent fault tolerance, combined with self-healing capabilities where agents can assume the responsibilities of their peers, ensures significantly higher availability and resilience. Furthermore, the modular nature of MAS simplifies bug isolation, effectively preventing unintended consequences from rippling through the system.\n\nFlexibility and adaptability are also defining characteristics of MAS. These systems can learn from their environment and adjust their behavior in real-time, a critical capability for dynamic applications. Integrating new features becomes as straightforward as introducing a new agent with a specific role, rather than undertaking a complex and time-consuming re-architecture. Resource management is also intelligently optimized, with computational loads distributed efficiently across specialized agents, leading to maximized performance and minimized latency.\n\nMulti-Agent Systems are far more than a theoretical concept; they represent a potent toolkit for building smarter, more resilient, and profoundly adaptable software. By embracing this collaborative approach to software design, you can unlock new levels of innovation and empower your applications to tackle challenges previously thought insurmountable.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👏 Great job!

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-12T16:26:18.993879Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-12T16:26:18.994117Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-12T16:26:18.999755Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-12T16:26:18.994090Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-12T16:26:18.998800Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.
